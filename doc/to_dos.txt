   140408: fm Mark; The LHFE section does not need fuel/oil, it needs a hobbs start/stop.

   140417: Added validation to trip creation, trip financials view (need fuel/oil cost mechanism)  
   
   ALTER TABLE `trips` ADD `lfhe_hobbs_start` decimal(8,1);
   ALTER TABLE `trips` ADD `lfhe_hobbs_end` decimal(8,1);
   ALTER TABLE `trips` ADD `show_fuel_gallons` int(6);
